## Finance

CRUD for personal accounts, the categories that classify money flows, and the transactions that move money in, out, and between accounts.

**Auth:** full-private. All endpoints require a `full` token (see [auth.md](auth.md)).

**Total:** every account has a `total` column maintained by a Postgres trigger on `transactions`. Income increases the total, expense decreases it, and a transfer simultaneously decreases the source account and increases the destination. The total is read-only via the API; it is never accepted in a request body.

**Transaction type:** `income`, `expense`, and `transfer` are values of a Postgres `transaction_type` enum reused on both `transactions.type` and `categories.type`. The matching Go enum lives in `internal/finance/txtype` and is wired through sqlc via an override, so every layer (DB row, generated params, DTO, handler validation) shares the same `txtype.Type` value. A transaction's category must have the same type as the transaction itself; the API rejects mismatches with 400.

## Overview

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint:** `/finance/overview`
- **Description:** Single roll-up used by dashboards. Returns the sum of every account's balance, this-month income/expense/balance (computed in the server's configured timezone, starting at midnight on the 1st), the equivalent figures for the previous calendar month, and every transaction from the last 30 days joined with account and category names.
- **Notes:**
  - `accounts_total` sums `accounts.total` directly. If accounts use multiple currencies the sum is naive — clients must show the breakdown themselves if that matters.
  - `month.balance = month.income - month.expense`. Transfers are excluded because they net out across accounts.
  - `previous_month` has the same shape as `month`. It is computed by summing transactions from the start of last month to the start of this month and lets clients render savings rate / month-over-month deltas without a second request.
  - `to_account_name` and `category_name` are nullable: the former is `null` for `income` / `expense`, the latter is `null` for legacy rows where the schema column is unset.
- **Success Response:**
  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:**
    ```json
    {
      "accounts_total": "8879.15",

## Stats

Four read-only endpoints power the chart sheets in the web client (`/money` page). The first three share the same date-range conventions:

- `from` and `to` are optional `YYYY-MM-DD` (or RFC3339) strings interpreted in the server's timezone.
- `to` defaults to *now*.
- `from` defaults to **the date of the earliest transaction** (`MIN(occurred_at)`), or, when there are no transactions yet, *now − 6 months*. Clients use this to implement an "All time" range simply by omitting `from`.
- All money values are returned as JSON strings (`NUMERIC(15,2)`).

### Net-worth series

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint:** `/finance/stats/networth`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `from`, `to` — date range (see conventions above).
  - `granularity` — one of `day` | `week` | `month`. Defaults to `day`.
- **Description:** Reconstructs net worth at the end of each period in the range. The current `SUM(accounts.total)` snapshot is the anchor; the value for each bucket is computed by walking back through transaction deltas (`+income`, `-expense`, `0` for transfers because they net within the user's portfolio). Buckets are aligned to `date_trunc(granularity, from)` and emitted by `generate_series(...)`.
- **Notes:**
  - The trigger-maintained `accounts.total` is the source of truth, so opening balances seeded directly on `accounts.total` (not as `income` rows) are correctly reflected as the starting net worth, while monthly income/expense aggregations stay clean.
  - Granularities other than `day` use the chart axis's "data points are already period-aligned" rule on the client side.
- **Success Response:**
  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:**
    ```json
    [
      { "date": "2024-05-01", "total": "5450.00" },
      { "date": "2024-06-01", "total": "5876.32" }
    ]
    ```
- **Error Responses:** `400` (`invalid from`, `invalid to`, `granularity must be day, week, or month`) · `500` `Failed to compute net worth`

### Stats by category

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint:** `/finance/stats/by-category`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `type` (**required**) — one of `income` | `expense` | `transfer`.
  - `from`, `to` — date range (see conventions above).
  - `account_id` (optional) — filter to transactions where this account is the source *or* destination.
- **Description:** Sums `amount` and counts transactions of the given `type` in the date range, grouped by `category_id`. Returns one row per leaf category with that type. Clients render the parent/child tree client-side using `/finance/categories`; this endpoint never aggregates up the parent chain.
- **Notes:**
  - `share` is each row's amount divided by the sum across all rows in the response (range-relative, not all-time). It is `0` when the range total is `0`.
  - `category_id` is `null` for transactions whose category was deleted before the schema required it; `name` falls back to `"Sin categoría"` in that case.
  - Sorting: `SUM(amount) DESC, name ASC`.
- **Success Response:**
  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:**
    ```json
    [
      { "category_id": 20, "name": "Rent",    "amount": "1750.00", "tx_count": 2,  "share": 0.469 },
      { "category_id": 19, "name": "Dinner",  "amount": "485.50",  "tx_count": 11, "share": 0.130 }
    ]
    ```
- **Error Responses:** `400` (`type must be income, expense, or transfer`, `invalid from`, `invalid to`, `invalid account_id`) · `500` `Failed to compute category stats`

### Monthly stats

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint:** `/finance/stats/monthly`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `from`, `to` — date range.
  - `account_id` (optional) — filter to transactions touching this account.
  - `category_id` (optional) — filter to transactions tagged with this exact category id.
- **Description:** Returns one row per calendar month in the range with summed `income`, `expense`, and computed `balance = income - expense`. Transfers are excluded by the `type IN ('income','expense')` filter — they net out across the user's accounts.
- **Notes:**
  - The `month` field is the `YYYY-MM` form of `date_trunc('month', occurred_at)`.
  - Sorting: `month ASC`.
- **Success Response:**
  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:**
    ```json
    [
      { "month": "2024-05", "income": "0",       "expense": "716.86",  "balance": "-716.86" },
      { "month": "2024-06", "income": "2459.44", "expense": "2016.33", "balance": "443.11" }
    ]
    ```
- **Error Responses:** `400` (`invalid from`, `invalid to`, `invalid account_id`, `invalid category_id`) · `500` `Failed to compute monthly stats`

### Estimation

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint:** `/finance/stats/estimation`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `start_month` (**required**) — `YYYY-MM` (or `YYYY-MM-DD`). Lower bound for the historical (actual) series. **Clamped server-side to the month of the earliest transaction** when there is data, so passing an earlier month is harmless (and equivalent to "all available history"). Without this clamp, the underlying `generate_series` in `/finance/stats/networth` would emit flat pre-data buckets equal to `SUM(accounts.total)`, pinning `firstTotal` to the present value and yielding a near-zero rate.
  - `end_month` (**required**) — `YYYY-MM` (or `YYYY-MM-DD`). The last month included in the projected series. Must be on or after `start_month`.
  - `mode` (**required**) — one of `rate` | `saving`. Selects how the projection factor is derived and applied.
- **Description:** Returns a monthly time series from `start_month` through `end_month`, split into actual and projected points. Actuals come from the same net-worth reconstruction used by `/finance/stats/networth` with `granularity=month`, covering `start_month` through the end of the **previous** calendar month (the most recent fully-completed month relative to the server's clock). Estimated points start from the current month and extend through `end_month`. The projection factor is derived from the actuals, **not** taken from a query parameter:
  - `mode=rate`: the implied compound monthly rate `r` such that `last_actual = first_actual × (1 + r)^n`, where `n` is the number of monthly steps between the first and last actual points. Returned as a percentage (e.g. `1.25` = 1.25%/month). Each projected month is computed as `prev × (1 + r/100)`.
  - `mode=saving`: the implied average monthly delta `(last_actual − first_actual) / n`, returned in the same currency unit as account totals. Each projected month is computed as `prev + saving`.
  - When there is fewer than two actual points (e.g. `start_month` ≥ current month, or no transactions in the window so the reconstruction yields a single bucket), `rate` and `saving` are `0` and projections stay flat at the last known total.
- **Notes:**
  - The response object — not a bare array — carries `points`, `rate`, and `saving` so clients can label the projection with the derived factor without recomputing it. `rate` and `saving` are *always* present; the field that doesn't correspond to the requested `mode` is `0`.
  - Each point's `date` is the first day of the bucket month (same convention as `/finance/stats/networth` with `granularity=month`).
  - `estimated` is `false` for actual buckets and `true` for projected ones. The two segments are contiguous: if the current month is May, the last actual point is April and the first estimated point is May.
- **Success Response:**
  - **Code:** `200 OK`
  - **Content:**
    ```json
    {
      "points": [
        { "date": "2025-12-01", "total": "8000.00", "estimated": false },
        { "date": "2026-01-01", "total": "8200.00", "estimated": false },

      ],
      "rate": "1.7521",
      "saving": "0"
    }
    ```
- **Error Responses:** `400` (`start_month is required (YYYY-MM)`, `end_month is required (YYYY-MM)`, `end_month must be on or after start_month`, `mode must be rate or saving`) · `500` `Failed to compute estimation`
